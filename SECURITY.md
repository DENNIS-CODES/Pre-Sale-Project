# GitHub Abuse Report

## User: Masterse113

## Repository: [Pre-Sale-Project](https://github.com/Masterse113/Pre-Sale-Project)

## Description of Abuse:
The repository and its associated user display suspicious behavior, raising significant concerns about potential abuse, malicious activity, and intellectual property violations. The following points summarize the key issues:

1. **Potential Malware or Exploits:**
   - The repository hosts a project involving a token presale and staking platform without sufficient validation or explanation, increasing the risk of malicious code.

2. **Plagiarism and Intellectual Property Concerns:**
   - The user explicitly requested to clone an existing staking platform ([alixa.io/stake](https://alixa.io/stake)), suggesting intent to replicate proprietary code without permission.

3. **Unverified and Risky Deployment:**
   - The project encourages deploying untested smart contracts on the Ethereum mainnet, which poses significant security risks to users.

4. **Unprofessional and Evasive Communication:**
   - Interaction with the user behind the repository was evasive, unprofessional, and failed to address legitimate concerns about the project's goals and authenticity.

5. **Lack of Transparency and Business Model:**
   - No clear business model or legitimate purpose for the project was provided, raising doubts about its intentions.

## How LinkedIn Bounty Hunters Exploit Blockchain Developers
There is a growing trend of LinkedIn "bounty hunters" targeting blockchain developers with fraudulent projects. These actors present themselves as recruiters or project managers with seemingly legitimate blockchain projects but use the following tactics to lure developers into compromising situations:

1. **Phishing with Malicious Code:**
   - They share open-source repositories, which often contain malware or vulnerabilities disguised as smart contracts or front-end code. Developers unknowingly integrate these elements into their workflows, compromising security.

2. **Cloning Legitimate Platforms:**
   - Fraudsters request developers to "fork" or replicate established platforms, potentially violating intellectual property laws and exposing developers to legal risks.

3. **Unrealistic Deployment Requests:**
   - They push for immediate deployment on mainnets without proper testing, leading to potential exploits or financial loss for users.

4. **Lack of Accountability:**
   - Communication is evasive and unprofessional, and the individuals often disappear after the initial interactions, leaving developers vulnerable.

## Recommendation for Action:
- Investigate the user and repository for potential violations of GitHub's policies.
- Audit the codebase for malicious content, unauthorized use of third-party code, or intellectual property theft.
- Consider suspending or removing the repository and associated user if abuse is confirmed.

## Supporting Evidence:
1. Repository: [Pre-Sale-Project](https://github.com/Masterse113/Pre-Sale-Project)
2. External Platform Referenced for Cloning: [alixa.io/stake](https://alixa.io/stake)
3. Screenshots and conversation logs demonstrating unprofessional and evasive behavior can be provided upon request.
